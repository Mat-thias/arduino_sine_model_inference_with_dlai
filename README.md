# arduino_sine_model_inference_with_dlai
This project demonstrates how to deploy and run a simple neural network model—specifically a sine regression model—on an Arduino UNO using the DLAI (Deep Learning Algorithm Implementation) library. It showcases the process of integrating a model trained in TensorFlow into a low-resource microcontroller environment.
